		<h1>My Story</h1>
		<p style="padding:10px;"> My name is Alexander Kyle Greco. I was born in New Jersey and have lived here my entire life. I lived in Hackettstown and went to Mount Olive High School. I was a varsity Lacrosse player for my whole high school career. I was accepted to Rowan University and several other colleges. I chose to attend Rowan University because my older sister already attended the University and it was far enough away from home, but still close enough it wouldn’t be hard to travel home. I came into college as a Biology major but decided after my freshman year that it wasn’t for me. My fall semester of sophomore year I decided I wanted to become a Computer Science major. At first programming was very hard for me to understand, but with the right teachers and hard work it started to make sense and became very interesting to me. That same semester I decided to pledge a fraternity on my campus. I was already on the E-board of the club lacrosse team, but I decided I needed to be part of an organization that was more involved with the campus and community. It was a great decision from the start and continues to give me opportunities socially and professionally. After my first year of being a computer science major I decided that I chose the right major. In the fall of my junior year I was hired for my first job that used my computer science skills and knowledge. I worked as a student IT worker for the Dean of Education. In the spring semester of my junior year I was offered a web development job, working for the Office of Student Activities. I have worked both jobs simultaneously since may of 2014.</p>
